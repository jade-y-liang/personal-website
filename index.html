										<p>About me</p>
									</header>
									<p> I am a 4th year undergraduate student at UCLA. I am double majoring in <b>Mathematics</b> with a
										<b>Specialization in Computing</b>, and <b>Statistics and Data Science</b>. 
										My fascination lies in the transformative power of data. I am particularly passionate about 
										applying statistical methods and data-driven insights to solve real-world problems. </p>

									<p>	With a strong foundation in mathematics, programming, and data analysis, I am actively seeking 
										internship and job opportunities in data science or analytics, where I can contribute my skills 
										and continue to grow professionally.

												<img src="images/recipes.jpg" alt="No-Plan Pantry Layout" class="resize-image" />
											</a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>No-Plan Pantry</h4>
												<p>A recipe recommendation web application that recommends recipes from allrecipes.com
													based on user inputted ingredients. The goal of this project is to reduce food waste
													by inspiring users to use their leftover ingredients to make a delicious meal! This web
													application also generates AI-generated recipes based on user-inputted ingredients.</p>

										<article>
											<a href="https://github.com/jade-y-liang/redfin-housing-analysis" class="image"><img src="images/houses.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Redfin Housing Analysis</h4>
												<p>In this ongoing project, I am responsible for cleaning and preprocessing a comprehensive 
													dataset from Redfin, aimed at understanding the dynamics of the housing market. The primary 
													goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast housing prices based on 
													various influencing factors.

											<a href="https://jade-y-liang.github.io/pic16b-blog/posts/hw5-image-classification/" class="image"><img src="images/cat-and-dog.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Image Classification of Cats and Dogs</h4>
												<p> This project leverages the power of deep learning to accurately differentiate between images
													 of cats and dogs. Using TensorFlow and Keras, a series of increasingly complex models were 
													 developed, starting from basic convolutional neural networks to sophisticated architectures 
													 employing data augmentation and transfer learning. Each model iteration was evaluated for 
													 performance improvements, culminating in a robust model that demonstrates an impressive 
													 accuracy of 96.73% on test data. </p>

											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Fake News Classification</h4>
												<p>This project explores the development of a machine learning model capable of identifying 
													fake news articles using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on a dataset that 
													includes titles and texts of news articles, along with labels indicating whether the news 
													is fake or real. The primary objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of using article 
													titles, texts, or both to predict the legitimacy of news. This involves pre-processing text
													 data, employing text vectorization, and building multiple neural network architectures to 
													 compare their performance.</p>

											<a href="https://github.com/jade-y-liang/academic-performance-analysis" class="image"><img src="images/academics.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Academic Performance Analysis</h4>
												<p>This project was completed as part of my final coursework in Stats 101A at UCLA. The goal was
													 to predict students' academic performance indices using a dataset of 10,000 entries from 
													 Kaggle. This analysis is crucial for understanding the factors that influence academic success
													  and can help educators tailor their approaches.</p>
